    "To run this file, I reccomend using Anaconda Navigator. To download, click the link below. Then open Anaconda Navigator, and click `Launch` under `Jupyter notebook`. Your browser will open with a screen to select which .ipynb file to open. Download and open this one, but before running, finish reading instructions. \n",

    "\n",
    "#### Easy way (Recommended)\n",
    "Create an empty github repository for free, and just upload your `TradingHistory.xlsx` file and this .ipynb file to your github repo. Since github will only run this once the first time you upload it, to update the results with new trade history file, simply delete both files from github, change this .ipynb file name to a new name and re upload it to github along with the new trading history. Then github will detect it as a new file and re calculate. :)\n",

    "\n",
    "The program calculates profits based on round-trip trades in the given time period. That is, for each coin pair, any sells that come before any buys and any buys that come after any sells will not be calculated. Thus, only full trades (trades that contain a buy and a sell) will be calcuated for profit. This is the most accurate way to determine how much profit you accumulated in the given time period of the exported excel file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The program calculates fees based on BNB. If you do not use BNB for fees, A. You should since its half the cost and B. you need to set the variable `use_fees` below to `False`. Note, this will calculate total profit without fees included."
